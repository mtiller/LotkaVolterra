LotkaVolterra
=============

This library is a complement to [a blog post](http://blog.xogeny.com/blog/eqs-to-comps2)
I created exploring how to transform the LotkaVolterra equations into a library of component
models for various ecological effects.

The goal of the library is to demonstrate (especially to people
from outside engineering) how the traditional system dynamics models
can be transformed into reusable component models and then easily
combined into complex system models.
